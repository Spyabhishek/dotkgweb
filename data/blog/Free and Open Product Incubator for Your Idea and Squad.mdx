Welcome, fellow developers!
====

![Gitlab CI CD](/static/images/incubator.avif)

I would like to open a SaaS incubator for young engineers who would like to make a thing of their ideas and capitalise to a business. The incubator will also organize a free yearly Developer's Bootcamp of 6 weeks.

Incubators(started first in USA, then UK & Europe) are usually office space along with tools, resources and network to nourish and grow the startups. My incubator can leverage from being one of the first to recognise the shift in the IT work culture -

- Offices are remote networks

- Tools and Docs are in cloud

- Software source code will be open sourced (not yet but eventually)

Business these days, more and more are shifting to use technology for user interaction, business give or take, manage operations and performance or growth analysis irrespective of which industry they are into.

### Objectives

## Free and Open

To inspire more and more developers to create softwares or side projects

- Use our community guides and source code to quickly create an MVP

- Use our free* resources to deploy projects to cloud and beta test

- Use our market channels to launch your product and use the community members as your first users and critics.

## Partnership and/or Benefits

To help a team of developers(or startup) to create, setup and grow their ideas into product

- Help product development, getting traction, onboard users and support setup.

- Assess product launch and market distribution

- Mentor the team to self sustain the product at minimum cost

- Refer products to venture capitalists for getting funded

### Services

- Integrate project management, communication, and process docs tools

- Setup product ecosystem Websites, SEO & Ads, Blogs, Community Forums etc.

- Setup automated infrastructure and cloud deployment for the project

- (Near future) Provide office space, legal advice, workshops and funding network

- (Near future) Provide end to end paid software development and design services

This incubator is going to take 2-3 years(alongside my job) to shape up into a final product. Meanwhile, I should continue making apps and solutions to empower “a developer's workflow”. This problem space is my expertise and the apps I am building will eventually be used by our incubates to quickly turn ideas into prototype.

Through this incubator I will try to solve the problems I am facing around projects like ButterOps Community, Reference Notes Ecosystem, Mr Jam Stack, Glimpse and Gandalf. All of these are my SaaS Initiatives as well.

If you subscribe to this idea of open incubator and would like to help along, let's connect.
